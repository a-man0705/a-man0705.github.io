							<h1 class="major">My Journey</h1>
							
							<p>My journey began in 2018 when I joined Lovely Professional University (LPU) in India to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. While studying, I secured a position as a Junior Data Analyst at Everest in 2019. Balancing both work and studies, I continued to excel in both realms until 2021. During this time, I gained invaluable practical experience in data analysis while furthering my academic knowledge. In 2021, seeking to broaden my horizons and delve deeper into the field, I made the decision to leave my job in India and transfer to Rowan University. This transition marked a new chapter in my academic journey, providing me with the opportunity to expand my skill set and pursue specialized coursework in data analysis. This blend of practical experience and academic pursuit has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis principles and methodologies, preparing me for future challenges and opportunities in the field.</p>

							<p>Following my graduation from Rowan University in 2022, I embarked on the next chapter of my journey by securing a position as a Data Analyst at American Software Group LLC. Joining this dynamic team has allowed me to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during my academic pursuits to real-world challenges. As I continue in my role, I am driven by a passion for uncovering insights from data and contributing to the success of projects that drive innovation and efficiency within the organization. Working at American Software Group LLC has provided me with valuable opportunities for growth and development in the ever-evolving field of data analysis.
